Then in Rhino run `RunPythonScript` from the command line, and execute the file `rhino_awesome_pave.py` (which you will find at the root of this repository).   
Alternatively you can create a new button with this command : `_-RunPythonScript "path\to\the\file\rhino_awesome_pave.py"` (don't forget to edit the file path)
